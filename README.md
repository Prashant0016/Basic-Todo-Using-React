# BASIC TODO [Using React]
  - This is my 2nd project using React , made for practise purpose only .
  - All Credits goes to BroCode [YouTube] , for the Learning Material .
  - To view the project , go insidethe src folder .
  - Just a Basic todo , which adds a particular task and you can move that task up or down acc to your priority and you can also delete one .
  - Added a few designs , did not add any responsiveness code because it has minimal elements .
  - Uploaded all files except node_modules folder .
